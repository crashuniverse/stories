<h1>Daisy</h1>

<p>Once upon a time in a big, green field, there lived a cute and innocent cow named Daisy.
  Daisy was white and brown with big, kind eyes. She spent her days munching on sweet,
  green grass and dreaming of adventures.</p>

<p>One sunny morning, as Daisy was happily chewing her cud, she heard a soft meow. She looked
  around and saw a clever cat sitting on the fence nearby. The cat was gray with shiny,
  green eyes and a mischievous smile.</p>
<img src={talk} alt="whispers cat" width="100%" />
<p>"Hello there," said the cat with a friendly purr. "I'm Whiskers. What's your name?"</p>
<p>Daisy blinked her big, kind eyes and replied, "I'm Daisy. Nice to meet you, Whiskers."</p>
<p>Whiskers hopped down from the fence and padded over to Daisy. "Daisy," Whiskers said
  with a sly grin, "I have an idea. How about we go on a road trip together? It will be
  so much fun!"</p>
<p>Daisy's eyes sparkled with excitement. She had always wanted to go on an adventure.
  "Oh, that sounds wonderful, Whiskers! Let's do it!"</p>

<p>So, Daisy and Whiskers set off on their road trip. They walked down dusty roads, crossed
  bubbling brooks, and even climbed a little hill. Along the way, they met friendly birds,
  chatty squirrels, and even a colorful butterfly.</p>

<p>As the sun began to set, Daisy and Whiskers found themselves in a cozy little town.
  The town had colorful houses, twinkling lights, and the sweet scent of freshly baked
  cookies filled the air.</p>
<p>Daisy and Whiskers decided to stop and rest for the night. They found a friendly farmer
  who offered them a warm barn to sleep in. Inside the barn, Daisy and Whiskers snuggled
  together and talked about all the amazing things they had seen on their adventure.</p>

<p>But as the night grew darker, Daisy started to feel a little homesick. She missed her
  green field and her friends, the other cows. She whispered to Whiskers, "I miss home,
  Whiskers. I want to go back."</p>
<p>Whiskers understood how Daisy felt. He knew he had to help his new friend. "Don't worry,
  Daisy," Whiskers said softly. "I'll help you find your way back home tomorrow."</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Whiskers woke up and guided Daisy back to her big, green field.
  Daisy's heart was filled with joy as she saw her familiar surroundings and her cow friends.</p>

<p>Daisy turned to Whiskers and said, "Thank you, Whiskers, for the wonderful adventure.
  You're a clever and kind friend."</p>
<p>Whiskers smiled and replied, "You're welcome, Daisy. I'm glad I could help you. If you
  ever want to go on another adventure, just let me know."</p>
<img src={bye} alt="whispers cat" width="100%" />
<p>And so, Daisy and Whiskers said their goodbyes, knowing that they would always be
  friends, even if they lived in different worlds. Daisy went back to her happy life
  in the big, green field, and Whiskers continued his clever adventures, knowing that
  true friends are always there when you need them.</p>
